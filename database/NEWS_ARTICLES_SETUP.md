# News Articles Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and manage the custom news articles feature in the Dorama Hub app.

## Overview

The news articles system allows you to create, manage, and display custom news content instead of relying on external Twitter feeds. This provides better control over content quality and user experience.

## Database Schema

The system uses the following main tables:

### Core Tables
- `news_articles` - Stores the main article content
- `article_tags` - Normalized tag system
- `article_tag_relations` - Many-to-many relationship between articles and tags

### Analytics Tables
- `article_interactions` - User interactions (likes, shares, bookmarks)
- `article_views` - Detailed view tracking for analytics
- `article_bookmarks` - User bookmarks
- `article_comments` - Optional commenting system

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run the Migration

Execute the migration script to replace the old Twitter-based system:

```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor
\i database/migrate-to-custom-news.sql
```

Or manually run the contents of `database/news-articles-schema.sql`.

### 2. Configure Row Level Security (RLS)

The schema includes comprehensive RLS policies:
- Published articles are readable by all authenticated users
- Authors can manage their own articles
- Users can manage their own interactions, bookmarks, and comments

### 3. Set Up Storage (Optional)

If you want to upload images directly to Supabase instead of using external URLs:

```sql
-- Create a bucket for article images
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('article-images', 'article-images', true);

-- Allow authenticated users to upload images
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload article images" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'article-images');

-- Allow public read access to article images
CREATE POLICY "Public read access to article images" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT TO public USING (bucket_id = 'article-images');
```

## Content Management

### Creating Articles

Articles can be created through:
1. Admin interface (to be built)
2. Direct database insertion
3. API endpoints (tRPC procedures)

### Article Structure

Each article includes:
- **Basic Info**: title, slug, status (draft/published/archived)
- **Content**: HTML content, plain text version
- **Metadata**: tags, cover image, author info
- **SEO**: meta description, reading time
- **Analytics**: view count, like count, share count
- **Featured**: can be marked as featured for homepage carousel

### Sample Article Creation

```sql
INSERT INTO news_articles (
    status,
    title,
    slug,
    tags,
    cover_image_url,
    html_content,
    plain_text_content,
    author_name,
    published_at,
    is_featured,
    meta_description
) VALUES (
    'published',
    'Your Article Title',
    'your-article-slug',
    ARRAY['K-Drama', 'Lan√ßamentos'],
    'https://example.com/cover-image.jpg',
    '<p>Your HTML content here...</p>',
    'Your plain text content here...',
    'Author Name',
    NOW(),
    true,
    'Article meta description for SEO'
);
```
